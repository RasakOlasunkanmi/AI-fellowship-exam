Question 1

I built a basic calculator with continuous use following the instruction given prompting the user to perform the following choice of operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
I used functions to define each operation.
I used try-except to handle invalid input and division by zero.
I used control flow (if-elif-else) to select the correct operation.
I used a while loop to keep running until the user chooses to exit.





Qusetion 2
I completed the missing parts of the program given as instructed so that it keeps asking the user for a number and tells whether it is even or odd.
I used input, int conversion, if-else control flow, and print output.
I used a while loop that runs until the user types 'exit'.





Question 3
The given code is supposed to ask for a user’s age repeatedly and say whether they are allowed to vote (18+) and it should also exit if the user types 'exit'. However, the code contains errors. And i was able to;
Identify and fix the errors.
I ensured the program uses try-except to catch invalid input.
I ensured it uses a while loop to keep asking until 'exit' is typed
